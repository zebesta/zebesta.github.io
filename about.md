This is a simple website to list some of the projects I'm currently working on. When Im not sitting in a coffee shop and working on code, I'm riding bikes, snapping photos, and exploring this concrete jungle I'm currently calling home.

We're at an exciting point in history where access to educational resources and information is becoming practically free and creating something amazing requires little more than a keyboard and the internet. In that spirit, I like to keep the things I'm working on free and open source so that anyone can take, learn, borrow, and improve. Feel free to take a look at my source code on my {% include icon-github.html %}[GitHub.](https://github.com/zebesta)
