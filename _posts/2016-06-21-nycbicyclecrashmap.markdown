NYC Bicycle Crash Map is an Android app to visualize motor vehicle crashes involving cyclists in New York City. This app is built using information provided by NYPD under the NYC Open Data Initiative. The goal is to show this data in a user friendly, familiar, and intuitive way so that cyclists can make informed decisions about the roads they take on their travels throughout the city.
