Garden Helper is a super simple Android app to list information about common garden plants. This app is built using readily available gardening information, but the goal is for me to personally experiment with animations, transitions, and dynamic layouts for landscape mode, tablets, and larger resolution devices.

Check out the [Garden Helper App][garden-helper-apk] under development in my dropbox and give it a try! If you have any feedback feel free to send it my way.
