This hosts a static HTML and Javascript site that solves and visualizes how linear regression is used to approximate a best fit curve for data on a 2d plot. The user can vary the learning rate (alpha) and observe how the cost converges or diverges based on overshooting, and how the rate of cost reduction varies with learning rate as the cost is plotted against the number of iterations. The numerical representation for the approximation function (theta) and cost is visible at each iterative step and a sequence of plots can be played to show a continuous visualization of this process.


Check out the [Linear Regression Web App][linear-regression] and give it a try! If you have any feedback feel free to send it my way.
